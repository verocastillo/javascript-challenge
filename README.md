# UFO Search! JavaScript and DOM Manipulation Homework.
In this repository, I wrote code that created a webpage that contains a table dynamically based upon a provided dataset on UFO sightings. This table can be filtered based on specific values. I only used JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js.

## Navigating Through The Repository

The structure of the repository is simple:

1. In UFO-level-1, you can find the main assignment with its html, css and js files.
2. In UFO-level-2, you can find the main assignment with its html, css and js files.
3. In images, you can find some screenshots of the working webpage.

## Level 1

I created a basic HTML web page based on the provided starter html code. Then, using the UFO dataset provided, I wrote code that appends a table to the web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting. This table can be filtered by date, which requires an input from the user. The working page can be visited on: https://verocastillo.github.io/javascript-challenge/UFO-level-1/

## Level 2

In level 2, I covered all of the requirements from level 1, with the addition of having multiple filter options. I used select dropdowns to filter the dataset by date, country, state, city and/or shape. This is all written in the JavaScript code, so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings. I added a reser button that refreshes the page so you can filter the table from scratch. The dropdown options are extracted by the code in the JavaScript app. The working page can be visited on: https://verocastillo.github.io/javascript-challenge/UFO-level-2/
