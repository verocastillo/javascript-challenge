# UFO Search! JavaScript and DOM Manipulation Homework.
In this repository, I wrote code that created a webpage that contains a table dynamically based upon a provided dataset on UFO sightings. This table can be filtered based on specific values. I only used JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js.

## Navigating Through The Repository

The structure of the repository is simple:

1. In UFO-level-1, you can find the main assignment with its html, css and js files.
2. In UFO-level-2, you can find the main assignment with its html, css and js files.
3. In images, you can find some screenshots of the working webpage.

## Level 1

I created a basic HTML web page based on the provided starter html code. Then, using the UFO dataset provided, I wrote code that appends a table to the web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting. This table can be filtered by date, which requires an input from the user. The working page can be visited on: https://verocastillo.github.io/javascript-challenge/UFO-level-1/
